# What is Redis?
### Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker.

## Redis supports the following types of data structures:
strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

### Redis works with an in-memory dataset. Redis also allows you to persist the datasets by dumping them to a disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.
